# pproxy

This is a lightweight image of [pproxy](https://github.com/qwj/python-proxy),
based on [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).

It is a lot smaller than alternative currently-available pproxy images, and is
automatically updated any time there is a change to any of the transitive
Python dependencies.
